# Recognition service
A repository with a service for executing recognition of documents. This repository is part of [Microservice Reference Framework](https://github.com/MichalMoudry/microservice-reference-framework "Link to Microservice Reference Framework repository").

## Getting started
This section contains ways to get started (running, deploying, ...) with this service.
### Local deployment
For running this app locally, you need to have the following:
| Requirement | Version | Addditional info |
|----|----|----|
| Python | >=3.10 | |
| Installed all the dependencies | - | This means having installed all the libraries in requirements.txt file |
| Running an instance of PostgreSQL | | |

### Cloud deployment

## Service architecture

For architecture overview of the entire system, visit: [Microservice Reference Framework Repository](https://github.com/MichalMoudry/microservice-reference-framework "Link to Microservice Reference Framework repository").

## Project structure
- **/src** - A folder with the source code for this service.
    - **main.py** - The entry point for the service.
    - **/transport** - A module containing a transport layer of this service. Transport layer contains stuff like:
        - Classes (Data Transfer Objects) that are used as models for HTTP requests and responses.
        - Additional validation methods.
        - Package for helping with REST API metadata.
    - **/service** - A module representing a service layer. Service layer contains all the business logic of this service. So, this module contains things like:
        - Classes that run OCR on the uploaded images.
        - Packages that help with the processing of uploaded image/files.
        - Package that enables sending of messages in the entire system.
    - **/database** - A module representing a database layer of this service. This module contains elements like:
        - Model classes for the SQLAlchemy ORM (Object Relational Mapper) system.
        - Database migrations which are used by Alembic to properly version the database scheme.
- **/test** - A folder with all the tests for this project.
    - **/test_images** - A folder with images that are used for the purpose of testing recognition and file upload.
    - **/unit_tests** - A folder with packages that contain unit tests of this service. Tests cover things like:
        - Testing if recognition of text on images works.
    - **/integration_tests** - A folder with packages containing integration tests of this service. Tests cover things like:
        - Correct API responses.
- **/.github/workflows** - Is a folder with YAML files containing definitions for GitHub Actions pipelines.
